<h1 class="NiceTitle">This website is made up of thousands of data structures.</h1>
<h2 id="minicooltitle">Data structures are everywhere. They affect how you see your email, the efficiency of the websites you use,
    and even the security that protects your personal informaion.</h2>

<h2>So, what <strong><em>are</em></strong> data structures?</h2>
<p>Data structures, at their simplest, are containers that store data. Data strucutres come in all shapes and sizes, used for
different functions. Some data structures are as simple as storing data in a short list while others are as complicated as 1000 lines
of code. Though data structures are fundamental to computer science, 
the most complicated ones can take a lifetime to master. </p><h5> Click on a link below to learn more about

<h2>Time and Space Complexity in Data Structures</h2>
<p>Time and space complexity are essentially indicators about how effective an algorithm is. If you would like to learn 
    more about how space and time complexty are measured, what they indicate, and why they matter, click <a href="Data Structure Files/Complexity.html">here</a>.

<h2>General questions about data structures</h2>
<details>
    <summary class="ToPSize">What's the difference between data structures and algorithms?</summary>
    <p id="OtherColor1">While data structures are containers that store data, algorithms are preset functions that execute specific orders
        onto a data set. Think of it this way: A data structure is the bag that holds your fruits, and the algorithms search for a specific
        fruit to pull out. Data structures typically have algorithms in their code. For example, an array data structure will have algorithms
        within it's code body to add items to the array, search for items within the array, and delete items in the array. Data structures
        typically have more functions than just an algorithm itself, but this is not always guarenteed.<br>To summarize:<br>Data
        structures are the containers that store data while algorithms perform functions on that data. Most data structures have algorithms
        within their code.

    <summary class="ToPSize">Why are data structures important?</summary>
    <p id="OtherColor1">I'm glad you asked! Data structures are important for a few different reasons. The first reason is that if 
        data structures have a mistake in their code, the website that uses those data structures becomes vulnerable for cyberattack.
        Knowing what your data structures do and how they work is crucial in creating a safe website.<br>The second reason that data 
        structures are important is that specific data structures can affect memory usage and runtimes in code. Especially when dealing
        with many data items, it is crucial to use the most efficient data structure.<br> The final reason that data structures are important
        is that they are the foundation for algorithms. Many of the most useful algorithms we use today do not work unless they are paired
        with specific data structures. Even programs as complicated as Artificial Intelligence rely on specific data structures to execute
        their algorithms.<br>To summarize:<br>Data structures are important for many reasons. The most prominent include online safety,
        memory usage and runtimes, and as setup for algorithms. No matter what they are used in, data structures are important for just about
        all types of computer usage.

<summary class="ToPSize">What are some common data structures?</summary>
<p id="OtherColor1">Technically, there could be infinate data structures and more and 
    more and more practical data structures are being discovered by the day. However, 
    four many categories of data structures exist: Linear data structures, Tree data structures, 
    Hash tables and Graph data structures.<br>Linear data structures include arrays, Linked Lists, and 
    other types of data structures that store items in a "line".<br>Tree data structures logarithmically split data 
    down a line to create efficient searching. This includes Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees, Red-Black Trees,
    Avalon Trees, and more types of Binary trees like these.<br>Hash tables include tables that convert text 
    into hashes, and they are the base of online security. Hash tables are usually not practical in larger
    programs but are crucial to making a secure online world.<br>Graph data structures are typically complex
    and use specialized items to simulate flows of graphs and find correlations.<br>To summarize:<br> Since a data structure
    could refer to many types of code structures, there are four main types of data structures: Linear data structures which include
    arrays, Tree data structures which include Binary Trees, Graph data structures which include complex algorthims and Hash data 
    structures that include Hash Tables.
