<h1>The Types of Fish: A Short Story</h1>
<p>Another interesting but not-so-creepy fact about me: I fish a lot! I have gotten quite good and 
    sell my catches for money. Before I go into all the types of fish, remember: All parts of the page matter.
    <br>First, salmon. Nothing beats a good salmon. Grilled with a smoky taste, or baked in the oven, you can't 
    go wrong with it.
    <br>Second, sea bass. Absolutely delicious. In my opinion, it is the best cooked fish ever.
    <br>Let's talk herring. My favorite type of herring is definitely <em>RED HERRING</em>, but other types can taste good as well.
    <br>Tuna. <em>THIS STORY</em> I read one time told me about how sad tuna feel sometimes when you catch them, which kinda
    made me lose my motivation to fish for them. Plus, the process of catching them <em>IS A WASTE OF TIME.</em> I mean, it takes forever
    to just catch a single fish! But mmm baby, they are good on sushi.
    <br>Those are some of the basic types of fish. If you would like to learn more, go <a href="https://kids.nationalgeographic.com/animals/fish">here</a>. And remember, anything can be a clue!!!

<p>Okay, okay. Enough about that. Time for the next clue. Oh, wait just a moment... Seems like my computer is glitching...<br><br>
