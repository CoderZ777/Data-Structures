<h1>Basics of C++</h1>
<p>C++ is a pretty cool programming language. It is one of the most used programs to create robots! Now, isn't that cool?
    However, it is what we call a "low-level" language. That basically means that it is easy for a computer to digest.
    High-level programming languages such as python need many different "decoding" steps to break down into something that 
    a computer can read, c++ doesn't need as many of these steps. Anyways, I don't really need this whole page to talk about 
    the syntax of the code. Something that is super interesting about C++ is constants. You can read more about them 
    <a href="https://cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/constants/">here</a>. And this is the last time I will remind you: everything can be a clue!
