<html><h1>A nice story...</h1>
<p>I will tell you, everything to the very last molecule in this page is there for a reason. For example, 
    did you know that the color of most text on this page is the color of my eyes? The rgb 
    value of it is (28, 34, 59). Well, there's a fun, if 
    creepy, fun fact about this page. Well, do you remember when I told you a while back that everything in this 
    page has a reason to be there(If you don't remember, search long and hard across this whole website to find it)? 
    Well, then that has to mean that this short story is here for a reason, too, doesn't it?...

<p>Okay, here is your actual clue:<br>Go <a href="../Data Structure Files/BST.html">here</a>, then find the first number 
that will be in the output if you perform a postorder traversal on the second 
tree image. Next, go to that line in code and click on the third space.</p></html>
