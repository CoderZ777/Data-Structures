<h1>What is a stack?</h1>
<p>A stack is a data structure similar to a queue but follows a different rule. It follows the rule, LIFO. LIFO stands 
    for Last In First Out. Think of it as a <em>stack</em> of papers or plates; The most recent item you add to the stack, 
    the most recently it will become removed. Adding an item to a stack is called <em>pushing</em>, while 
    removing the top item is called <em>popping</em>.

<p>1. Function Push(Argument ToInsert)<br>
    2. Check if the stack is full.<br>
    3. If the Front is equal to 0 and the Rear is equal N-1, the stack overflows and returns.<br>
    4. Otherwise, set the Rear to Rear + 1.<br>
    5. Set the Stack's Front to the ToInsert.<br>
    6. Return the function.<br><br><br>
    7. Function Pop<br>
