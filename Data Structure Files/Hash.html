<h1>What is a Hash?</h1>
<p>A hash can be described a simple data structure that stores key-value pairs. This article will focus on hash security - 
    how hashes can be used in cryptography. Hashing is a bit like the Enigma machine in WWII. It uses a complicated algorithm 
    to encode text into an about 30 character code. Computers can then read a hash to find out what a password was. 
    However, the hash for encoded text is always the same. For example, the hash for password123 is always 
    <b>42f749ade7f9e195bf475f37a44cafcb</b> no matter what. Because of this, hackers can make a database called a 
    <em>Rainbow Table</em> that stores common passwords and keys. So, if a hacker finds a hash and plugs it into a rainbow table, 
    they may have a chance of getting the password.

<h1>What is a Salt and Why is it Important?</h1>
<p>Salts are what can make hashes more powerful by adding a second security measure. A salt is a string of characters added 
    before a password before it gets hashed, for example <em>1g59</em>(in reality, salts are usually longer than this
    - usually over 48 bits.) This changes the whole hash of the password, rendering rainbow tables mostly useless. 
    However, since the salt is typically stored in a computers data, a hacker still might be able to find the salt and get 
    the password. That being said, a salted hash is typically secure, or at least secure enough to encrypt basic passwords.

<h1>So, are Salted Hashes Secure?</h1>
<p>Now that we know what hashes and salts are, the question comes: Are salted hashes secure? It depends on how 
    secure a program needs to be. For most functions(i.e. your password to common websites, your google account), 
    salted hashes are sufficient. For a hacker to find your password from these hashes,<br> 1] The hacker would need an 
    extremely powerful computer<br>2] The hacker would need an extensive amount of time and <br>3] The password would need to 
    be relatively insecure.<br>With that being said, however, important sections such as bank accounts often use other security 
    or additional layers of security to protect passwords because of the stakes that come if the password gets cracked.
