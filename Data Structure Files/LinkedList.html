<h1>What is a Linked List?</h1>
<p>A linked list is a collection of items called Nodes. Each node stores a value as well as another node called 'next'.
    This is the next item in the list. Chaining all of these Nodes together, all of these items form a rudimentary list.

    1.Class Linked List<br>
    2.Store a Node called Head<br>
    3.Store a Node called Tail<br><br><br>
    4.Class Node<br>
    5.Store an integer called Value<br>
    6.Store a Node called Next<br><br><br>
    7.Function AddItem(arguments: A linked list and a value to add)<br>
    8.If the linked list has nothing in it, add a head Node storing value and pointing to null<br>
    9.Otherwise, make the current tail point to a new Node storing the value<br>
    10.That node becomes the tail<br><br><br>
    11.Function AddItemAfter(arguments: A linked list called List, a value to add called Value, a node that should be before the adding node called After)<br>
    12.If the linked list has nothing in it, add a head Node storing value and pointing to null<br>
    13.And if the tail is the value to add that item after, run function AddItem with Value and stop this function.
    14.Otherwise, make a new node storing Value and After's next value<br>
    15.Make after's next value the new Node we made storing value.
