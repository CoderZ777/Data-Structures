<h1>What is a queue?</h1>
<p>A queue is a very simple type of data structure that is like a grocery line. It follow what we call, "FIFO": 
    First In First Out, which means that the <em>first item</em> that is added into the data structure is the 
    <em>first item</em> to come out. Adding an item to the cue is called <em>enqueueing</em> while 
    removing an item is called <em>dequeueing</em>.
