<h1 class="OtherNiceTitle">RUE with Expert</h1>
<p>In our RUE, we mostly learned about cryptography in computer science. 
    Below I will explain some of the topics we discussed.<Br><br>

    Let's say you and a friend are trying to give each other passwords to their computers, but a hacker 
    is listening in to every word you say. How can you communicate what you want to say without the hacker 
    knowing your passwords? Think about a potential solution for a moment, then continue on below.<br><br><br>
    The most straightforward answer to this question is to use a code. If you agree on a code in advance to use
(such as multiplying each number by 2, then adding 5), you can speak the encoded message while the hacker still 
cannot find out your password. Now, let's explore more advanced cryptography methods and weaknesses.

<h2>&#128064;I Know the File&#128064;</h2>
<img src="../Images/HTMLEx.png" alt="An Example of an HTML File">
<p>Let's say you are trying to encode a whole HTML file using an algorithm. HTML is used to display most 
    online text(For example, this website is created with HTML). Look at the image above to see an example of 
    HTML code. You may notice the dark blue 'tags' that include the <> symbols by them. When endcoded, it would 
    be trivial for a hacker to see that the file is html if they notice these repeated symbols. With that knowledge, 
    they could likely figure out the algorithm and see what is displayed on the page.<br>For this reason, 
    special, complicated algorithms have been developed to hide these tags and not allow hackers to break into code.
</p>
<h2>Too Hard to Tell</h2>

<p>Sometimes, less security is more. For example, let's say you are just sending one bit. This has two 
    possible meanings(0 or 1) and two possible encoded messages(0 or 1). Knowing just this information, it is 
    impossible to tell if the sender wanted the recipient to know if it was a 0 or 1 because there is not enough information 
    to make anything more than a guess.

<img src="../Images/BinaryCode.png" alt="A diagram of binary code" length="35%" width="35%">
<p>This diagram shows the encoding. There are two possible 'plaintext'(Decoded text) options: 1 or 0. 
    Similarly, there are two possible 'ciphertext'(Encoded text) options: 1 or 0. 
    Because of this clever method, we cannot find patterns in an encoded message if it is small. for this reason, 
    it is often safer to send many small messages over seperate platforms than one long, complicated message. Even with 
    superior security, long messages can become possible to crack
